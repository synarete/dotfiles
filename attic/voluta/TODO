* NAME_MAX = 1023

* Fix the case of rmdir with still-open dir-file-decscriptor

* copy_file_range (UT)

* Add verify code to all sub types (volume.c:voluta_verify_bk)

* XATTR:
  - Extra sanity tests
  - Check with XATTR_REPLACE
  - Impl replace in-place
  - VFS-tests with all permutation, mixed with other ops

* Per inode accounting: data-blocks, meta-blocks

* Checksum on every meta-data block

* Put some order in messy headers

* Align with GNU project style (ChangeLog etc)

* Proper cleanup of all resources upon fini

* Inline data in inode for small files

* Improve super_block ?

* Extra ut-record tests with steps between offsets + truncates

* Stage meta-bk: always check type (dir?)

* Have version 'syscallx_getdents' with external user-provided buffer

* Store timezone in inode

* Store dir-depth in inode

* Store root-inode with true ino number

* tests: Design and impl fschaos

* Flags on inode: version, hash-type etc

* Inode: Store back-reference to dirent (parent-ino + doff).

* docs: Known issues:
  - export GVFS_DISABLE_FUSE=1
  - edit /etc/fuse.conf with:
      mount_max = 1000
      user_allow_other

* Junctions (read-only): mkjoint

* Wrap and test with: utimensat, futimens

* Account meta-blocks per inode

* Tests: check pre-requisets: getrlimit, expect at least 2G memory

* Tests: Sanity: check utimes, utimensat, futimens

* FUSE: TMPFILE

* FUSE: SEEK_DATA, SEEK HOLE

* FUSE: copy_file_range

* FUSE: FIEMAP

* FUSE: fuse_sync_fs vfs hook

* FILE: Special support for small files (size <= blksize)

* FUSE: Support READDIRPLUS

* Make server multi-threaded on mount + SIGNAL handling

* Use IOMAP + multi-threading for rw IO path

* Support 'man 2 ioctl_fideduperange'

* UNION: maybe have content-id per inode?

* UT: stress: fill entire file system

* Pseudo fs: <mount-point>/.voluta/

* Assertion macros only in DEBUG mode; have special die_if macros which are
  always valid

* FUSE3 + readddirplus

* RFC4880

* Possible repository layout:
  .
  ├── objects/
  ├── volumes/
  ├── config
  ├── index
  └── version

* Support FIEMAP (provide FUSE patches!) see ZUFS

* Proper handling for FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE beyound file size

* Support ASCII only names with bit-per-char option

* doc: "DPS: Data Protection Service"

* GNOME logout: https://github.com/backloop/gendsession

* Seal-file: chage file to permanent read-only mode
