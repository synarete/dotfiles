"I think what happens is that every time a new language comes out it cleans up
what’s understood about the old languages and then adds something new,
experimental and so on, and nobody has ever come to the point where they have
a new language and then they want to stop at what’s understood. They’re always
wanting to push further.

Maybe someday somebody will say, "No, I'm not going to be innovative; I'm
just going to be clean and simple, and I'm going to stick to it." Pascal was
started with that philosophy but then didn't continue. Maybe we'll get to a
time when somebody will say, "Let's set our sights lower and really try to
make something that's going to be stable." It might be a good idea.

"I came across this rerelease of Coming From Reality. The liner notes said,
'There are no concrete hard facts about the artist known as Rodriguez. Any
musicologist-detectives out there?' was the question, and I think that, to me,
was like an invitation."
