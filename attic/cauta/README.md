# The Cauta Programming Language

**CAUTION -- AREA UNDER CONSTRUCTION**


Cauta is a strongly typed, modular, procedural programming language. It is
aiming to be an evolutionary step within the family of the C languages, which
provides software developers a safe and productive tool for modern system
programming.

Cauta is named in honor of Benedict de Spinoza's motto of "CAUTE" -- the Latin
word for "be cautious" (or "careful").
