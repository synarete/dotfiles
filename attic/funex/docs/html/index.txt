Funex is a `FUSE`_ based filesystem for GNU/Linux, primarly designed to store
large files (images, videos, databases, vmdks etc.) on modern storage devices.
It is a free software, released under the terms of the `GNU General Public
License`_. Funex is named after `Ireneo Funes`_, Borges' fictional character
who had the talent of remembering everything.

..

.. highlights::

  **NOTE**: Funex is a young project and its code-base is under heavy
  development. The filesystem on-disk format is unstable and likely to change.
  Thus, at its current state it should be considered experimental and **should
  not** be used to store critical data.
